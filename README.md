It is time I am honest with you: I am a nerd. I love to learn new things. I am a sit-in-the-front-row-question-asker for life. I love exploring big ideas and paying attention to minute details. Software development checks both these boxes: each letter, each semi-colon, each curly bracket matters when building a rich website.

I also love to be on the front lines of change. Creating good applications is a moving target and we have new tools to use daily (hourly?) as we code. The developer world is wide and diverse, I love that innovation matters.

And I believe that all work and play is done better alongside other human beings. Writing functional code is one thing, but writing and debugging code that endures for others to improve upon... that is the craft. My favorite professional accomplishments cannot be separated from the people I worked alongside.

Or, to put it another way:

Imagine you and I are teammates playing basketball in a loud, hot gym. You just made a clutch play that prevented the other team from scoring which led to our team sinking a three pointer from the corner (Great job, by the way!), which then led to the other team to call a timeout because we just took the lead.

My absolute favorite part of that scenario would be getting back to the bench to celebrate as a team and coaching staff because of what WE had just accomplished.

I like working with people. Also, I like basketball, and grilling, and shoes, and music.
